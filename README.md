Understanding the Technical Requirements
Research: Before starting the coding, itâ€™s vital to understand the specific memory management aspects you're addressing, such as Resident Set Size (RSS), Swap Size, and Working Set Size (WSS).

Knowledge Gathering: This might involve studying existing kernel modules, understanding how memory management works in the Linux kernel, and reviewing relevant documentation or scholarly articles.


Designing the Solution
Architecture Design: Decide on the structure of your kernel module. This includes how it will interact with the kernel, manage memory, and perform measurements.

Algorithm Development: Develop the logic for measuring memory statistics. This might involve deciding how to access and interpret the process memory data provided by the kernel.

Developing the Code

Coding: Write the kernel module code. This involves using the C programming language and adhering to the Linux kernel coding standards.
Integration: Ensure that your module correctly integrates with the Linux kernel, respecting synchronization and concurrency requirements, and handling any potential security issues.
Testing and Debugging

Initial Testing: Run the module in a controlled environment to see if it performs as expected. This might involve measuring the memory usage of test processes.
Debugging: Analyze and fix any issues that arise during testing. This could be related to memory leaks, incorrect memory measurements, or compatibility issues with different kernel versions.

Optimization and Refinement

Performance Optimization: Look for ways to optimize your code for better performance. This could involve reducing the overhead of memory measurement or optimizing data structures used.
Refinement: Refine the solution based on test results and feedback. Ensure that the module is stable, efficient, and meets the project requirements.

Documentation and Code Review

Documentation: Document your code thoroughly, explaining how it works, its structure, and any important considerations or limitations.
Peer Review: Have your code reviewed by team members or mentors. This helps catch any issues you might have missed and ensures code quality.

Final Testing

Comprehensive Testing: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure that the module works correctly in different scenarios and environments.
Validation: Validate that the module meets all project requirements and specifications.
Preparing for Deployment
Deployment Preparation: If the module is to be deployed in a real-world environment, prepare it for deployment. This might involve final checks, compatibility testing, and ensuring it adheres to any deployment guidelines.
